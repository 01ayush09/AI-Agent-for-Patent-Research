# AI-Agent-for-Patent-Research

**AI-Agent-for-Patent-Research** is a modular, production-ready AI research agent designed to automate and scale product research workflows using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), semantic embeddings, and intelligent task orchestration. This system can ingest, index, retrieve, and synthesize structured and unstructured data for deep product insights — including patent analysis, competitive research, and knowledge discovery.

## Project Overview

Modern product research — from competitive benchmarking to patent analysis — often requires synthesizing huge volumes of data across disparate sources. This repository provides a **flexible, agent-driven pipeline** that:

- Collects product and research data from multiple sources
- Builds vector embeddings for semantic search
- Uses agentic RAG to answer complex research queries
- Integrates domain-specific tools (e.g., OpenSearch, custom search clients)
- Provides extensible modules for automated insights

This project is ideal for AI engineers, researchers, and product teams looking to accelerate data-driven decision making.
